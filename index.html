            Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (30 April 1777 – 23 February 1855) was a
            German mathematician and physicist who made significant
            contributions to many fields in mathematics and science. Sometimes
            referred to as the Princeps mathematicorum (Latin for '"the foremost
            of mathematicians"') and "the greatest mathematician since
            antiquity", Gauss had an exceptional influence in many fields of
            mathematics and science, and is ranked among history's most
            influential mathematicians.

          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <h3>Early years</h3>
          <p>
            Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick
            (Braunschweig), in the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (now part of
            Lower Saxony, Germany), to poor, working-class parents. His mother
            was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering
            only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the
            Feast of the Ascension (which occurs 39 days after Easter). Gauss
            later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of
            finding the date of Easter, deriving methods to compute the date in
            both past and future years. He was christened and confirmed in a
            church near the school he attended as a child.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gauss was a child prodigy. In his memorial on Gauss, Wolfgang
            Sartorius von Waltershausen says that when Gauss was barely three
            years old he corrected a math error his father made; and that when
            he was seven, he confidently solved an arithmetic series problem
            (commonly said to be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100) faster than
            anyone else in his class of 100 students. Many versions of this
            story have been retold since that time with various details
            regarding what the series was – the most frequent being the
            classical problem of adding all the integers from 1 to 100. There
            are many other anecdotes about his precocity while a toddler, and he
            made his first groundbreaking mathematical discoveries while still a
            teenager. He completed his magnum opus, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,
            in 1798, at the age of 21—though it was not published until 1801.
            This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a
            discipline and has shaped the field to the present day. Gauss's
            intellectual abilities attracted the attention of the Duke of
            Brunswick, who sent him to the Collegium Carolinum (now Braunschweig
            University of Technology), which he attended from 1792 to 1795, and
            to the University of Göttingen from 1795 to 1798. While at
            university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important
            theorems. His breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a
            regular polygon can be constructed by compass and straightedge if
            the number of its sides is the product of distinct Fermat primes and
            a power of 2. This was a major discovery in an important field of
            mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since
            the days of the Ancient Greeks, and the discovery ultimately led
            Gauss to choose mathematics instead of philology as a career. Gauss
            was so pleased with this result that he requested that a regular
            heptadecagon be inscribed on his tombstone. The stonemason declined,
            stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like
            a circle. The year 1796 was productive for both Gauss and number
            theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30
            March. He further advanced modular arithmetic, greatly simplifying
            manipulations in number theory. On 8 April he became the first to
            prove the quadratic reciprocity law. This remarkably general law
            allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic
            equation in modular arithmetic. The prime number theorem,
            conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the prime
            numbers are distributed among the integers. Gauss also discovered
            that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most
            three triangular numbers on 10 July and then jotted down in his
            diary the note: "ΕΥΡΗΚΑ! num = Δ + Δ' + Δ". On 1 October he
            published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with
            coefficients in finite fields, which 150 years later led to the Weil
            conjectures.

          <h3>Career and achievements</h3>
          <h4>Algebra</h4>
          <p>
            In his 1799 doctorate in absentia, A new proof of the theorem that
            every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be
            resolved into real factors of the first or second degree, Gauss
            proved the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that every
            non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients
            has at least one complex root. Mathematicians including Jean le Rond
            d'Alembert had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's
            dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically,
            by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to
            the implicit use of the Jordan curve theorem. However, he
            subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being
            generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex
            numbers considerably along the way. Gauss also made important
            contributions to number theory with his 1801 book Disquisitiones
            Arithmeticae (Latin, Arithmetical Investigations), which, among
            other things, introduced the triple bar symbol ≡ for congruence and
            used it in a clean presentation of modular arithmetic, contained the
            first two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, developed the
            theories of binary and ternary quadratic forms, stated the class
            number problem for them, and showed that a regular heptadecagon
            (17-sided polygon) can be constructed with straightedge and compass.
            It appears that Gauss already knew the class number formula in 1801.
            In addition, he proved the following conjectured theorems: Fermat
            polygonal number theorem for n = 3 Fermat's last theorem for n = 5
            Descartes's rule of signs Kepler conjecture for regular arrangements
            He also explained the pentagramma mirificum (see University of
            Bielefeld website) developed an algorithm for determining the date
            of Easter invented the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm for calculating
            the discrete Fourier transforms 160 years before Cooley and Tukey
          </p>

          <h4>Astronomy</h4>

          <p>
            On 1 January 1801, Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the
            dwarf planet Ceres. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more
            than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky.
            Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several
            months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not
            locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to
            extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three
            degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit. Gauss heard about
            the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he
            predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year
            after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a
            half-degree when it was rediscovered by Franz Xaver von Zach on 31
            December at Gotha, and one day later by Heinrich Olbers in Bremen.
            This confirmation eventually led to the classification of Ceres as
            minor-planet designation 1 Ceres: the first asteroid (now dwarf
            planet) ever discovered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gauss's method involved determining a conic section in space, given
            one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given
            lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an
            ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to
            traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths
            of the arcs can be calculated by Kepler's Second Law). This problem
            leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution,
            the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated
            from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work,
            Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for
            that purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            One such method was the fast Fourier transform. While this method is
            attributed to a 1965 paper by James Cooley and John Tukey, Gauss
            developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method. His paper,
            Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata, was only published
            posthumously in Volume 3 of his collected works. This paper predates
            the first presentation by Joseph Fourier on the subject in 1807.
            Zach noted that "without the intelligent work and calculations of
            Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again". Though Gauss had
            up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the
            Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not
            believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support.
            Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed
            Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical observatory
            in Göttingen, a post he held for the remainder of his life.
          </p>

          <p>
            The discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the
            motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually
            published in 1809 as Theoria motus corporum coelestium in
            sectionibus conicis solem ambientum (Theory of motion of the
            celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the
            process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of
            18th-century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone
            of astronomical computation. It introduced the Gaussian
            gravitational constant, and contained an influential treatment of
            the method of least squares, a procedure used in all sciences to
            this day to minimize the impact of measurement error.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gauss proved the method under the assumption of normally distributed
            errors (see Gauss–Markov theorem; see also Gaussian). The method had
            been described earlier by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805, but Gauss
            claimed that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795. In the history
            of statistics, this disagreement is called the "priority dispute
            over the discovery of the method of least squares.
